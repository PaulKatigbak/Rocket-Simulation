## Project Introduction:

This project aims to examine a simplified version of a rocket simulation. While an exact
replica of a rocket simulation would be out of the scope of this course, a simplified ver-
sion still addresses much of the physics behind rocket simulations. This project uses all the resources learned from the Simulation and Modelling course.

All relevant reports and graph are contained in their respective directories. 

The report is formatted with double spacing, and using the template provided, resulting in approximately 8 pages of content.

### How to Run:

1. Clone the repository on your machine.
2. Using your IDE  (preferably VSCode), open the project folder.
3. Run the main.py file.

### Caution when Running Code:

1. After the rocket lands, avoid pressing any keys to prevent crashes.
2. Do not venture too far from the designated area during operations.

### Additional Notes:

1. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any issues or have questions about the project.

2. Have fun exploring and experimenting with the code!
